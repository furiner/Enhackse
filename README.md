## Enhackse

A small little cheat GUI made for a [small and simple game](https://github.com/vicplusplus/Enhance) published by [a friend of mine](https://github.com/vicplusplus).

### But Why?

I felt like it, really. I wanted to learn at base how Mono Injection worked, and to consolidate my knowledge using the tools readily available for me; and because I got [*reasonably* upset with a friend of mine](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/964016657074884638/1154477089299378186/DiscordDevelopment_RU4PpdMtoT.png). Some things can just never be forgiven. You'll be quick to disappoint once you figure out that this is the most basic code in the universe.

### The How

* Terrible Unity Knowledge;
* PEVerify to validate that I can't modify Assemblies well;
* dnSpy to read code that is open source and my dumbass didn't figure that out;
* A Mono Injector (most are broken <3)
* A lot of useless time
